# October Update
Rust's October 2023 update brings a lot of new features and changes to the game.

One of the most noticeable changes in the update is the new building skin called Brutalist, which will change the appearance of stone tier structures to a more concrete-like look. The Brutalist skin will give players more options to customize their bases and make them look more realistic and gritty. The Brutalist skin can be applied to any stone tier building block, such as walls, floors, roofs, stairs, and doors.

Another major addition in the update is the new weapon called the Homing Missile Launcher, which will allow players to fire guided missiles at targets and enemies. The Homing Missile Launcher is a rare and powerful weapon that can be found in military crates or bought from bandit camps. The Homing Missile Launcher uses special rockets that can lock on to any entity that emits heat, such as players, animals, vehicles, or turrets. The Homing Missile Launcher can also be used to destroy enemy bases or raid monuments.

The update also introduces a new feature called the Rail Network Link, which will connect the underground and above ground rail networks and allow players to travel between them. The Rail Network Link will add new stations and tunnels to the map, where players can find trains, carts, loot, and enemies. The Rail Network Link will also add new events and puzzles that will require players to use their skills and teamwork to complete.

The update also adds a new feature called the Tutorial Island, which will be a special type of training server where new players can learn the basics of the game through missions and challenges. The Tutorial Island will teach players how to craft, build, survive, fight, and raid in Rust. The Tutorial Island will also reward players with skins and items that they can use in the main game.

The October update adds a lot of new content and improvements that will enhance the game experience for both new and veteran players. We cannot wait to see what you get up to on wipe!
