# December Update: Happy Holidays!

Rust is getting ready to drop its December 2023 update, which will bring new features, fixes, and improvements to the game. The update is scheduled to release on December 7th, 2023 at 2PM EST / 7PM BST, and it will include some exciting changes that will spice up the gameplay and the visuals of the game. Here are some of the highlights of the upcoming update:
- Airborne Attack: A new event that will challenge players to survive a helicopter attack that will rain down homing missiles on players and bases. The event will be triggered randomly and will last for a few minutes. Players can use parachutes to escape the danger or loot the helicopter wreckage for valuable items. The event will also create a lot of noise and smoke, which will attract other players and animals to the area.
- Armored Hot Air Balloons: A new vehicle that will allow players to fly around the map in style. The armored hot air balloon can be crafted using metal fragments, gears, and fuel, and it can carry up to four players and a lot of loot. The vehicle has more durability and storage space than the regular hot air balloon, but it also consumes more fuel and makes more noise. The vehicle can be damaged by bullets, rockets, and melee weapons, and it can also catch fire if it gets too close to flames or explosions.
- Weapon Rack Item Pack: A new cosmetic item pack that will add weapon racks to the game. The weapon racks can be placed on walls and floors, and they can store and display up to four weapons each. The weapon racks can be customized with different skins and colors, and they can also be locked to prevent unauthorized access. The weapon racks will add more realism and decoration to the game, and they will also allow players to show off their arsenal to their friends and enemies.
- Twitch Drops: A new feature that will reward players for watching Rust streams on Twitch. Players can link their Steam and Twitch accounts and receive random items every hour of watch time. The items can range from common to rare, and they can include skins, blueprints, resources, and more. The feature will also benefit streamers, as they will be able to attract more viewers and subscribers to their channels. The feature will be available for a limited time, so make sure to tune in and claim your rewards.
- Emoji Support: A new feature that will enable players to use emojis in chat and signs. Players can type :emoji: to insert an emoji, or use the emoji picker menu to select one. The feature will support hundreds of emojis, including some custom ones made for Rust. The feature will add more fun and expression to the game, and it will also allow players to communicate better with other players.
