    <p>Join us on September 6th as we return to The Jefferson Asylum for another escape house event, where the players will have to fight for their lives with nothing but their survival instincts and intellect. Players will start in their cells and have to work together to navigate their way through boobytrapped halls and rooms while solving puzzles and trying not to lose their cool. Think you have what it takes to escape the asylum? Then show us what you're made of and join us on the Rusty Operations server on September 6th.</p>
