# Exciting September Update in RUST Introduces Game-Changing Features

In a much-anticipated September update, the world of RUST has been rocked by the introduction of the Attack Helicopter, stealing the spotlight. This brand-new addition, distinct from the familiar Patrol Helicopter, empowers players with the ability to commandeer an air vehicle capable of accommodating two players. These formidable flying machines are available for purchase at the Airwolf shop nestled within the Bandit Camp, although they come at a hefty scrap cost. Pilots can also customize these helicopters with an array of rockets and weapons, turning them into formidable aerial assault platforms.

The Attack Helicopter boasts a two-player setup, featuring a pilot and a gunner. The gunner enjoys access to a sophisticated targeting screen, granting them the ability to meticulously survey their surroundings and orchestrate precision aerial attacks. While the gunner takes charge of the mounted turret, the pilot wields the artillery controls, allowing them to unleash both rockets and flares, making this a versatile airborne weapon.

In an unexpected twist, the September update also bestows some love upon the Hot Air Balloon. Players can now enhance the durability and health of their Hot Air Balloons by equipping them with Hot Air Balloon Armor, available for purchase at Airwolf. However, it remains uncertain whether this new feature will impact the natural spawning of balloons in the game world, a detail that will be closely monitored and reported on.

For players whose piloting skills might be lacking or who find themselves under the constant threat of SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) sites, there's a crucial addition - parachutes. These parachutes serve as a last-ditch survival measure against fatal falls. Equipping a parachute in the newly introduced clothing inventory slot enables players to deploy it while airborne. Once deployed, players can expertly guide their parachutes using familiar WASD controls, ensuring a safe descent. It's important to note that SAMs and homing missile launchers cannot target parachutes, although players can still attempt to shoot and damage them, adding a layer of strategy to the gameplay.

Despite the apparent advantage that aerial attackers might enjoy, the update brings a ray of hope for land-based defense with the introduction of the Homing Missile Launcher. This new weapon system is finely tuned for tracking and locking onto aerial threats. Players can load the launcher with homing missiles, select their target, and a progress bar near the crosshairs indicates when the targeting system has successfully locked onto the intended object. Once locked, players can fire the missile and must skillfully maintain their crosshair on the target during the missile's flight to maximize its effectiveness.

In addition to these groundbreaking changes, this week's RUST update also includes several other noteworthy features and improvements:
- The potential deployment of weapon racks on tugboats.
- The possibility of clan tables being deployed on tugboats.
- Substantial enhancements and updates to Tutorial Island.

The RUST gaming community can now look forward to an even more dynamic and engaging experience with these game-altering additions and improvements in the September update. Stay tuned for further developments and strategies as players adapt to these exciting changes.
