    <p>We're excited to announce our new wave defence event, Rusty Ops! This event will be a wave defence event where you and your fellow operators will have to defend against waves of enemies. You will be able to purchase weapons, ammo, and other items to help you defend against the waves. By killing enemies you will earn money which you can use to purchase new weapons.</p>
    <p>We look forward to you joining us!</p>
