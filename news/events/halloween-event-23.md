# Rusty Operations Halloween Event
<br>
**October 29th at 4PM GMT - 12PM EST - 6PM CET**
<br>
<br>
On Sunday 29th October we will be hosting our very own Halloween event on our Discord server. For those of you who came last year, it will be just as much fun! An evening full of games, social activities, and laughs. We have a few things planned, so feel free to come along to some of the activities that interest you and stay as long as you like.
<br>
<br>
Here is the schedule for the evening:
<br>
* Scary Movie Time - 2 hours
* Spooky Gaming Session - 2 hours
* Social Games - 2 hours

Some events may run later than usual, but we will try to stick to the schedule as much as possible.
<br>
<br>
We will be voting on which movie to watch, video game to play, and social game to play, so keep an eye on our Discord announcements channel to take part in the votes!
If interested, we'd kindly ask you to visit the [Discord event page](https://discord.com/events/651455552517570586/1159055552647798794) and mark yourself as interested so we can estimate numbers.

We look forward to you joining us!
