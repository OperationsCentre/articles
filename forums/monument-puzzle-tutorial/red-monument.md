For your efforts, you will be greatly rewarded with 3 elite crates, 2 military crates and 2 normal crates. The military tunnels are irradiated so make sure to wear something to protect you!

Enter in the right door and keep heading right until you find the door marked "Armory". Inside, you will find a fusebox and a timer. Place your fuse in the box and activate it and the timer. 

Now, head back out the way you came and down the tunnel that curves right. You will find a hole in the fence; go through it and look for a door marked "Storage". This requires your green keycard.

Head to the right and flip the switch marked "Laboratory". Then head out and head left towards the core.

There are grates in the rail car! Exit the rail car and go right. Then head straight until you find the Laboratory door. Open the door with your blue keycard and activate the timer. Then go through the red door. Well done! The exit is on your left!
