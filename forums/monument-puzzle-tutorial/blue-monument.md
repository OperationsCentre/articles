# Blue Keycard Monuments

Blue keycards are the second tier of keycard. These can be located at [Green Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/green-monument) Monuments or by purchasing them at the tools vending machine in the Outpost with 100 scrap.

There are 4 monuments with blue keycards: Airfield, Power Plant, Trainyard and the Water Treatment Plant.

## Airfield

To gain access to the Power plant, you will need:
- [Green Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/green-monument)
- Blue Keycard
- 2 Electric Fuses

Welcome to the Airfield. Here, you will find 8 crates (1 behind the green door) and 1 [Red Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/blue-monument).

The airfield is also irradiated, but slightly less so. Make sure to bring some meds with you!

First, go to the main building. There is a door that leads to the garage. Once through the door, place the fuse on the room to your right. You will also notice a door which requires the blue keycard. Don't worry, we'll come back!

Go down the tunnel entrance which is located outside the hanger. Inside, you will find a door which requires your [Green Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/green-monument). Place your last fuse in the room to your right.

Go back to the blue door and enjoy your loot!

## Power Plant

To gain access to the Power Plant, you will need:
- [Green Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/blue-monument)
- Blue Keycard
- Electric Fuse

Be careful though! The Power Plant is irradiated, so you will want some protective gear. Our recommendation would be a hazmat suit.

You can find an assortment of loot in the Power Plant. This includes 5 barrels, 7 crates (3 behind the green door and the rest behind the blue door) and a [Red Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/blue-monument).

In the Power Plant, you will find a 3-story building in one of the corners of the airfield, with a switch located under the stairs on the outside of the building. Make sure to turn on this switch.

Go to the building with the slanted roof. Inside will be another switch. Make sure to activate this one, too. Make sure to also activate the accompanying timer.

You may now access the main building with your [Green Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/green-monument). There will be a switch in this building on the ground level. Make sure to activate it. 

Now go up the stairs and you will find the door that requires a blue keycard. The loot is now yours!

## Trainyard

To gain access to the Power plant, you will need:
- [Green Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/green-monument) (Optional)
- Blue Keycard
- Electric Fuse

The Trainyard is just as irradiated as the Power Plant so a hazmat suit is recommended! You will also have a nice helping of 3 barrels, 10 crates and 1 [Red Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/blue-monument).

Go to the 3-story building. Activate the switch on the ground level.

Next, there is a switch on the top floor of the tower. Flick it!

Now, locate the fusebox in the main building. It is located in the back-right corner of the room accessed via the first flight of stairs on the outside of the building. 

There is an optional green door which is located up the stairs you just found. Go up 1 more flight of stairs and you have your green door.

## Water Treatment Plant

To gain access to the Power plant, you will need:
- Blue Keycard
- Electric Fuse

Just like the Power Plant and Trainyard, the Water Treatment Plan is heavily irradiated. Make sure to bring a hazmat suit with you. For your troubles, you will find 10 crates and 1 [Red Keycard](https://www.rustyoperations.net/forums/view?override=forums/monument-puzzle-tutorial/blue-monument). 

This monument should be nice and easy. There is a 2-story building with blast doors that you can open with the wheel. Upstairs, there is a fusebox and a timer; turn on both.

Now go to the big building with the blue door. It is located round the back of the building up the stairs and enjoy the loot. Make sure to flip the switch in the back office to get out! We don't want you to get stuck.
